//Combinational always blocks are equivalent to assign statements, thus there is always a way to express a combinational circuit both ways.
//For synthesizing hardware, two types of always blocks are relevant:

//Combinational: always @(*)
//Clocked: always @(posedge clk)   //this creates a set of flip-flops

//A note on wire vs. reg: The left-hand-side of an assign statement must be a net type (e.g., wire), while the left-hand-side of a procedural assignment (in an always block) must be a variable type (e.g., reg). 
//These types (wire vs. reg) have nothing to do with what hardware is synthesized, and is just syntax left over from Verilog's use as a hardware simulation language.
